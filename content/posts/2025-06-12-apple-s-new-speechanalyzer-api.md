Just saw Apple dropped a new **SpeechAnalyzer API**. Interesting stuff. Looks like it's designed for more detailed speech analysis, not just basic transcription.

My first thought: this could be pretty neat for **Dreamers Dash**. We've been kicking around ideas for audio-based clue verification, and this might be the ticket. Instead of just simple keyword spotting, maybe we could use this to understand more nuanced spoken responses or even verify if a player is mimicking a specific sound or phrase.

Definitely something to dig into. If it's robust enough, it could make audio interactions in the game way more interesting than just tapping a button or typing.

Here's the announcement video if you want to check it out:

Need to add this to my list of things to experiment with. Could be a cool way to level up some of the puzzle mechanics in Dreamers Dash.

The `SpeechTranscriber` seems particularly interesting. It currently supports Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish. That's most of the languages I will need for support in Epcot's world showcase.
