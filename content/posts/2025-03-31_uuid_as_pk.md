title: 'UUID as Primary Key'
---

While working on [DreamersDAsh](https://app.dreamersdash.com) I decided to make all primary keys UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers.

The huge benefit here is that I can generate the id on teh client before the record is inserted into the database.

Then if I ever need to poll for updates, I already know the ID, so it is very simple to make a GET request for the record with the matching ID.
