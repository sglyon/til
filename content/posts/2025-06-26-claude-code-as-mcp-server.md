I just discovered that Claude Code can function as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This seems like it could be incredibly powerful!

I haven't had a chance to explore it yet, but the implications are exciting. It could enable entirely new workflows where Claude Code serves as a backend for other MCP clients like:

- Claude Desktop app
- VS Code extensions
- Other MCP-compatible tools

The idea of having Claude Code as a programmable server that other tools can interact with opens up some interesting automation possibilities. You could potentially have Claude Code running in the background, handling requests from various clients and coordinating complex development tasks.

Here's the documentation link for anyone interested: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#use-claude-code-as-an-mcp-server

I'll need to dig into this more and see what kinds of workflows this enables. The fact that Claude Code can both consume MCP servers AND act as one itself suggests some really interesting architectural patterns might be possible.
