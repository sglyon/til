title: 'Apple Foundation Models'

At WWDC25 Apple introduced their new Foundation Models Framework.

This is Swift-based access to an on-device LLM provided by Apple with the operating system.

The library allows for many interesting features such as structured outputs, customizable prompting, tool calling, and more.

It seems like a really great way to tap into intelligent features inside the app. I'm excited to try it out in Dreamer's Dash.

This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJMvFyBvZEk) explains the core features of the Foundation Models Framework.
