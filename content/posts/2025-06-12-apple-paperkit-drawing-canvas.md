TIL about Apple's new PaperKit framework announced at WWDC25. It provides a canvas and drawing tools that developers can integrate into their apps.

I'm working on Dreamers Dash and this caught my attention immediately. We've been thinking about adding more interactive clue response types beyond just text input.

A drawing response type could open up tons of creative possibilities:
- Sketch-based puzzles
- Visual riddles where you draw the answer
- Path-finding challenges
- Creative interpretation clues

PaperKit handles all the complex stuff - touch processing, drawing tools, canvas management. Looks like it could save weeks of custom implementation work.

Definitely want to explore this for Dreamers Dash once I get some time to dig into the details. Could be a game changer for making clues more engaging and interactive.
